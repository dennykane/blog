### The "blog post"

I've spent the last decade of my life working on a new kind of
interface into your computer's storage and logic circuits. I call it "Linux on
the Web". As all the hipster JS coders say: It works best with Chrome.  The
quickest way to get started is to just go [here](/shell).  That would be the
shell interface, with no gui to dazzle you or hotkeys to fret over.  First, you
want to be a full believer in the fact that browsers can actually hold onto
your files and remember them between page reloads. Then, you can go [here](/desk),
to see how it all gets rendered, real fancy-like.

So like this is another paragraph of an obviously **very** well thought out blog
post. One thing I wanted to mention about that last very though. All I had to
do to make the very look like **very** was to sandwhich it between \*\*'s. That's
because I just installed the markdown command on my machine, which I use to
turn this file written in markdown format into html.

And life will continue to get even better for you, dear reader, for the blogging 
fun continues without abatement or addendum or errata or ersatzes of any shape,
flavor or fortune. Or famine. Or anything that goes with it, I bless you all. 
No bed of roses.

least at little bit longer &#x21d4; "I am living ad-nozzium-ly," said a
erstwhile balding / fatting / shorting character actor in the location of
around the spots in the sports of the spunks-about-the-wollowby, lingering
limply in the lineup of the Madd-is-on Av-i-new yokel spokel jokel motel.

Said it. Yed it. Nosfeter-edit. &#x2295; Go west jung man. Mae west go east. A
gain, again. A loss, alas or less or even lesser and
